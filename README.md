Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data
Project Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis classifier for Twitter data, categorizing tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to demonstrate text data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation in Python.

Features
Cleans and preprocesses raw tweets

Vectorizes text using TF-IDF

Trains a Naive Bayes classifier (changeable to Logistic Regression or SVM)

Evaluates model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization

Works with any dataset containing tweets and sentiment labels

Dataset
Kaggle - Twitter US Airline Sentiment

You can also use the Twitter API to fetch your own data.

Installation
Clone this repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-twitter.git
cd sentiment-analysis-twitter
Set up a Python environment (recommended)

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or "venv\Scripts\activate" on Windows
Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Main dependencies: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, seaborn, matplotlib

Download NLTK data (inside Python)

python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
Usage
Edit the paths as needed for your dataset and run the main script or Jupyter Notebook:

python
python sentiment_analysis.py
or open sentiment_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

Results
The model achieves test accuracy and F1-score reported in the notebook output.

Visualization includes confusion matrix and sample classified tweets.
